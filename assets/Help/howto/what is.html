			What is a breadboard?
		</h1>
		<div>
			<p>A breadboard is a piece of hardware that allows someone to create, test, and debug computer circuts before putting it on a miylar board.  They consist of a array of pins, power, input pins, output pins and ground pins.  Take note of the image in figure 1.1.</p>

			Power pins give a +5 volts to any wires or other devices conected to them.<br>
			Ground pins are grounded and are needed to complete a circut.<br>
			Dip Switches labeled 1 to 8 toggle the power flow through the input pins A to F respectively.<br>
			Input pins supply a +5V when the corrasponding dipswitch is on.  The LED located above each one lets you know if that group of input pins has power.<br>
			Output pins are grounded and turn on when a power is supplyed to them.
			Pin array is where all your circutry is done.  It incorperates the power, input, output, and ground pins.<br>
		</p>
		<div>
			<p>The pin array can be broken down even further into the top rail, the top half, the gap, the bottom half, and the bottom rail (Figure 1.2).</p>

		<p>
			The top and bottom rails are connented horizontaly.  So if power is supplied to any pin in them they all are connected.  You generaly connect the +5V to the top rail and the ground to the bottom rail.  From there you would distrubute the power.<br>
			The top half and bottom half are different.  Their pins are connected vertically and are separated by the "Gap".  This means that if power is given to a pin in the top half all the pins vertically from that pin in the top half would then have power.<br>
			The gap is a very useful part of the breadboard.  It is the right space for a chip to be inserted (it also is the only place the "<em>Virtual Breadboard</em>" will let you put it).  Since the top and bottom half's pins are connected vertically it allows you to control each pin individualy.<br>
