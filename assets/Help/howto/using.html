					<td>Chips</td>
					<td>Click on the pin on the breadboard where the chips top left pin (usualy pin 14) is to be placed.  Chips may only be placed to span the gap so you can only select the pins in the bottom row on the top half.</td>

					<td>Seven Segment Display</td>
					<td>Click on the pin on the breadboard where the seven segment displays pin 14 is to be placed.  Seven segment displays may only be placed to span the gap so you can only select the pins in the bottom row on the top half</td>

					<td>LED</td>
					<td>Click on the pin on the breadboard that you want the positive end of the LED to be connected to then click the pin on the breadboard that you want the negetive end to be connected to.  Since LEDs are diode this does matter.  Electricity will flow only form positive to negitive.</td>

		<p>Using the proporties of each tool supplied in "The components" section wire up your breadboard.</p>
		<p>Once every thing is hooked up the way you want it just hit the power dipswitch (beside the power LED and lable).  This will execute your breadboard.</p>
