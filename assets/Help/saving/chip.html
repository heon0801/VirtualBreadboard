				Saving as a Chip
			</h1>
		</p>
		<p>Saving as a chip will allow you to create your own chips for use in your breadboard.  What it does is take all your inputs and outputs from your breadboard then places them in a chip.  This allows you to save some wiring and simplify your breadboards.  To save your breadboard as a chip simply select "<em>File</em>" then select "<em> Save as Chip</em>".  Then a save diolog box will appear.  Simply navigate to where you would like the chip to be saved then hit save.  The chip will be saved with a .vbc extention so you can easily find it later.</p>
